Each column has a name and a data type, and can hold a specific value for each row in the table. CSV CSV stands for \"Comma-Separated Values\". It is a file format that is used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or a database table. In a CSV file, each row represents a record, and each column represents a field. The values in each field are separated by a delimiter, such as a comma or a semicolon. Data Data refers to any information that is stored in a database. This can include text, numbers, dates, images, or any other type of information that can be represented in a digital format. Database A database is an organized collection of data. Drop A command used to remove an object (such as a table, view, or stored procedure) from a database. When you drop an object in MySQL Workbench, it is permanently deleted from the database and cannot be recovered. Therefore, it is important to use the \"drop\" command with caution and only when you are sure that you no longer need the object. Execute/Run To \"run\" or \"execute\" a query means to submit it to the database server for processing. When you run a query in MySQL Workbench, the server processes the query and returns the results (if any). Export Export is the process of extracting data from a database and saving it to an external file or application. In the context of databases, data export involves copying data from a database to a file, another database, or an external application. Import Import is the process of bringing data from an external source into a database. In the context of databases, data import involves copying data from a file, another database, or an external application into a target database. MySQL Workbench MySQL Workbench is a graphical user interface tool for managing and developing MySQL databases. It provides features such as database design, SQL development, server administration, data export and import, and visual tools for database management. Query A request for information from a database. It is typically expressed in SQL (Structured Query Language) and can be used to retrieve data, insert new records, update existing records, or delete records. Row In a database table, a row represents a single record or instance of the data being stored. Each row has a unique identifier, and contains a set of values for each column in the table. Schema A schema is a logical structure that defines the organization of data. A schema includes tables, views, procedures, indexes, and other database objects. A schema provides a blueprint for organizing and storing data in a database. Script A script is a set of instructions or commands written in a programming language or scripting language that can be executed by a computer or other device. In the context of databases, an SQL script is a file containing a sequence of SQL statements that can be executed as a batch to perform database operations. Select Statement A SELECT statement is an SQL command that is used to retrieve data from a database table. A SELECT statement specifies the columns to be retrieved, the table or tables to be queried, and any optional conditions or sorting instructions. The result of a SELECT statement is a set of rows that match the specified criteria. Spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets) Spreadsheets are software applications that allow users to organize and analyze data in a tabular format. Spreadsheets are commonly used for tasks such as budgeting, financial analysis, and data management. Examples of popular spreadsheet applications include Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. SQL SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a programming language used to communicate with a database. SQL statements are used to perform operations such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database. Table A table is a collection of related data items. A table is a set of columns and rows. Each column contains a specific type of data, and each row contains a record."},{"location":"SAM_SQL_TASKS/","title":"Common MySQL Workbench Tasks","text":""},{"location":"SAM_SQL_TASKS/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This section will cover common tasks in MySQL Workbench. it will go over the creation and deletion of schemas, tables, columns, and row.

If you have not clicked the lightning bolt icon, the query will not be run. Cannot create table - Check to see that there is a column attribute selected (e.g. \"NOT NULL\" or \"PRIMARY KEY\") in the column editor panel. If you do not select any attributes, you cannot enter a name for the column.  - Make sure you have checked a column attribute among the choices presented in the column editor panel and made a name for the column. If you have not done both of these in that order, the table cannot be created. Cannot see created table right click in the Schema panel and select \"Refresh All\". Cannot see table changes after SQL execution right click in the Schema panel and select \"Refresh All\". Successful CSV import but no data It may have been encoded wrong, make a new excel spreadsheet and re-enter the data. Then, convert the new excel spreadsheet. Incorrect syntax When running queries, ensure that the syntax is correct, and there are no spelling errors. Check that the tables and columns you are referencing exist and that the case of the table and column names match. Import order If the imported data contains foreign key constraints that reference other tables, you must ensure that the tables are imported in the correct order. The referenced table must be imported before the table with the foreign key constraint. Incorrect data types When inserting data into a table, ensure that the data types of the values you are inserting match the data types of the columns. Missing referenced data If the imported data contains foreign key constraints that reference data that does not exist in the referenced table, you may encounter missing data errors. To fix this, ensure that the referenced data exists before importing the data that contains the foreign key constraints. Problem entering path Make sure you have entered the path in the format without quotation marks as shown in the example.  If you have entered the path in the format with quotation marks, the path will not be recognized."}]}
