Cannot create table           |      must select one of the column attributes (e.g. "NOT NULL" or "PRIMARY KEY") in the column editor panel.  If you do not select any attributes, you cannot enter a name for the column.
Still cannot create table           |      Make sure you have checked a column attribute among the choices presented in the column editor panel and made a name for the column. If you have not done both of these in that order, the table cannot be created.
